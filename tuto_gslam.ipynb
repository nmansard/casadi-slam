    "Also, each landmark in the graph will be a 3D pose.\n",

    "Factors in the graph will be of three different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Motion factor, from one keyframe to the next.\n",
    "- Landmark factor, from one keyframe to one landmark.\n",
    "- Prior factor, from one keyframe to some absolute value, or from one landmark to some absolute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each factor will be associated with a particular cost function.\n",
