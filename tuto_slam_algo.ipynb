    "This tuto is intended to help you organize all the pieces of the SLAM system into a functioning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the algorithm is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Images will arrive\n",
    "- For each image, you will define a keyframe, storing position and orientation of the camera\n",
    "- For each keyframe, you need to link it to the previous one via a motion factor\n",
    "- You have to analyse the images and detect AprilTags on them\n",
    "- For each detected Tag, you will define a landmark\n",
    "    - Sometimes, the tag is already known: you need to identify it and create a factor\n",
    "    - Sometimes, the detected tag is new: you need to create a landmark and a factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is one of the many ways you can organize your code to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We advance n iterations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First iteration:  basic algorithm\n",
    "- Secon iteration:  bootstrap the 1st image\n",
    "- Third iteration:  set landmark warm-start values\n",
    "- Fourth iteration: add a keyframe prior\n",
    "- Fifth iteration:  add a landmark prior"
