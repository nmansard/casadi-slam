    "Geometrically, each **keyframe** in the graph will be a **3D pose**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, each **landmark** in the graph will be a **3D pose**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Factors** in the graph will be of three different types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Motion factor**, from one keyframe to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Landmark factor**, from one keyframe to one landmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prior factor**, from one keyframe to some absolute value, or from one landmark to some absolute value.\n",
    "  **NOTE:** you can have a prior in the first keyframe, or a prior in one of the landmarks. You CANNOT impose both priors, since they would most certainly conflict with each other!\n",
    "\n",
    "Each factor will be associated with a particular **cost function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **total cost** to be minimized by the solver will be the sum of the costs of each one of the factors.\n"

    "Each factor stores the necessary information for computing a cost function.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cost function compares the actual measurement against a prediction of that measurement made from the current states associated to the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost per factor\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost function is responsible for computing the cost of a given factor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since a factor involves a measurement and some states, we begin by computing the expected value $e$ of the measurement, given the states:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e = h(x_1, x_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $h()$ is a particular observation model, and $x_i$ are the states involved in the factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we compare our true measurement $y$ against the expected value $e$, obtaining what we call the prediction error $z$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "z = y \\ominus e = y \\ominus h(x_1,x_2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** see that we compare with a generic operator $\\ominus$ and not with a simple subtraction $-$. This allows us to compare magnitudes that do not belong to vector spaces, such as orientations in 3D. Read on to know how we deal with them!\n",
    "\n",
    "This error $z$ is then weighted by the square root of the information matrix, $W$, and then taken the squared norm. This yields the cost $c$ of the factor:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c = || W \\cdot z ||^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since factors are all of different nature and relate different states, it is necessary to index all variables correctly in formulas.\n",
    "Overall, the cost we have computed for a given factor $k$ is the following:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c_k = ||W_k(y_k\\ominus h_k(x_{i_k},x_{j_k}))||^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $k$ is the factor index\n",
    "- $i_k$ and $j_k$ are the indices of the two states associated to this factor\n",
    "- $h_k$ is the particular observation model for this factor\n",
    "- $y_k$ and $W_k$ are the measurement and sqrt-info-matrix of this factor\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The total cost for $K$ factors is the sum of the costs of all factors\n",
    "$$\n",
    "c = \\sum_{k=0}^K c_k = \\sum_{k=0}^K ||W_k(y_k \\ominus h_k(x_{i_k},x_{j_k}))||^2\n",
    "$$\n",
